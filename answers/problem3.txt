My representation has a object for a Node, Graph, and an Edge. The Edge just holds the parent Node name, child node Name, and the edge Label. 
The Node object holds its name and the Edges that point away from it in alphabetical order of their edgeLabel's in an arraylist.
The Graph holds theses nodes in alphabetical order by their names also in an arrayList.

The collection of edges there is easy iteration through edges.
For the Adjacency list can get outgoing edges in constant time.
For the adjacency matrix we can get the number of edges that connect two nodes in constant time.
The advantage for my representations is that it is way better to visualize in creating the graph and searching can take log n time 
for nodes or edges since they are alphabetically sorted.
